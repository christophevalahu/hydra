This is a software which visualizes error models for two-qubit microwave gates using trapped ions in a static magnetic field gradient.


Version history : 

  - 1.0 : First stable release. Plotting heating, decoherence, kerr and offres errors. Can support up to four traces. Can save and load files. 

To do : 
  
  - Complete HELP section
  - Refine off-resonant coupling error model with pulse-shaping.
  - Add amplitude noise error model for CDD gates
  - Add current noise for CCWs
  - Add radial STR and COM vibrational modes
